# uwp-iot-device

During the TechDay 2016 in Amsterdam a great workshop was provided in conjunction with The Things network.

This TechDays workshop had three parts:

Part one: Connection a TTN device to the Azure Cloud

Part Two: Handling telemetry in the Azure IoT Platform
https://github.com/JeeWeetje/ttn-azure-workshop/blob/master/Azure.md

Part Three: using Microsoft Flow as an extension of the Azure IoT Platform
https://github.com/JeeWeetje/ttn-azure-workshop/blob/master/Flow.md


This extra workshop shows you how to use a UWP app as an IoT device for Microsoft Azure IoT Hub.
